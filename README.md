## Salt ToDo

This is the classic Todo app exercise. Your task is to create a simple todo app - no backend required.

Exactly how you implement and design this is up to you - but your solution should be implemented in the files `index.html`, `js/todo.js` and `style/todo.css`. You may use the screenshot at the bottom of this page for inspiration.

You are **not** allowed to follow a tutorial!

### Requirements
1. Initially, the list of todo cards should be empty.
2. There should be a form where the user can add a new 'todo'.
3. When a new todo task is submitted from the form, a new todo card should be appended to the list.
4. Clicking on a todo card should visually mark the card as done. Exactly how is up to you.

### Additional functionality (optional) 
The list below contains additional functionality that is optional to implement. Treat them as suggestions. 
You are free to add other functionality (as long as the requirements above are still fulfilled) to your app if you come up with something better.

5. Add a remove button to cards marked as 'done'. When the button is clicked, the card should be removed from the board.
6. Store the current state in the browser's local storage. When the browser is shut down and then opened again, the state should be restored.
7. Move the cards marked as 'done' to the bottom of the list.
8. Add date and a timestamp to the cards. Sort the cards based on the timestamp. (Cards marked as done should still be in the bottom of the list)
9. Let the user decide whether to sort the cards in ascending or descending order.

## When you are done
Put all the files you've worked with in a folder named after yourself, zip the folder and then send it to Lars on Slack!
